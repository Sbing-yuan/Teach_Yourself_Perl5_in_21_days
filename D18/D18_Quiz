1. Given that $pointer is a pointer to a hash, what's wrong with the following line of code?
$x= ${$pointer->{$i}};
-> $x = $pointer->{$i}

2. Why is $b not being set in the following line of code? What do you have to do to make it okay?
sub xxx {
my ($a, $b) = @_;
}
-> only one input argument

3. What's the difference between these two lines of code?
printf "$i : $$pointer[$i++]; ";
printf " and $i : $pointer->[$i++]; \n";
-> the same, access de-refrecnce result

4. What do the following lines of code print out?
$HelpHelpHelp = \\\"Help";
print $$$$HelpHelpHelp;
-> "Help"

5. What's the use of the ${variable} construct? How could the following three
lines of code be rewritten?
$name = ${$scalarref};
draw(@{$coordinates}, $display);
${$months}[0] = "March";
-> create symbolic reference
-> $name = $scalarref;
-> draw($coordinates, $display);
-> $months[0] = "March";

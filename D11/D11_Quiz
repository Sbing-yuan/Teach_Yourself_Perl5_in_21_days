Define value fields that print the following:
a.    Ten left-justified characters -> @<<<<<<<<<
b.    Five right-justified characters -> @>>>>
c.    Two centered characters -> @|
d.    A floating-point number with five digits before the decimal point and three after it -> @####.###
e.    A field that prints as many formatted lines of 30 left-justified characters as necessary -> ~~^<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

What do these fields print?
a.    @<<<< -> left-justified 5 chars
b.    @|||||| -> centered 7 chars
c.    @ -> single char
d.    @* -> multline
e.    ~ ^>>>>>>>>> -> right-justified 10 char as many as possible

What do these printf field specifiers print?
a.    %5d -> right justified 5 decimals
b.    %11.4f -> 11 digit all 4 after decimal points
c.    %010d -> right justified 10 decimals with leading 0
d.    %-12s -> left justified 12 chars
e.    %x -> hexadecimal

Why do certain floating-point numbers have round-off problems?
-> not exactly stored, only closet equivalent

How do you create a page header for an output file?

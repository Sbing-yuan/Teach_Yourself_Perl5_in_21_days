Define the following terms:
associative array -> array with any scalar as subscript
pointer -> associative array value is another associative key
linked list -> key1 => value1(key2) => value2(key3) ... => valuen => null
binary tree -> data structure that each element point to 2 another element
node -> binary tree element
child -> binary element that are pointed

What are the elements of the associative array created by the following assignment?
%list = ("17.2", "hello", "there", "46", "e+6", "88"); -> ("17.2" => "hello", "there" => "46", "e+6", "88")

What happens when you assign an associative array to an ordinary array variable? -> (keyn, valuen, ...) key-value pair in random order

How can you create a linked list using an associative array? => $list_first = "first_elem" %list = ("first_elem" => "sec_elem", ...)

How many times does the following loop iterate?
%list = ("first", "1", "second", "2", "third", "3");
foreach $word (keys(%list)) {
last if ($word == "second");
} => range from 1 ~ 3, depends on %list order

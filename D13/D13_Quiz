What do these functions do?
a.    srand -> random generator, input argument is seed
b.    pipe -> process output as another process input
c.    atan2 -> two input arguments, arctange(val1/val2)
d.    sleep -> suspend program x s
e.    gmtime -> return greenwich mean time

Explain the differences between fork, system, and exec.
fork -> create child process
system -> create other program start
exec -> terminate old one before new start

Explain the differences between wait and waitpid.
wait -> wait any child process end
waidpid -> wait particular child process end

If the scalar variable $string contains abcdefgh, what do the following calls return?
a     substr ($string, 0, 3); -> "abc"
b.    substr ($string, 4); -> "efgh"
c.    substr ($string, -2, 2); -> "gh"
d.    substr ($string, 2, 0); -> ""

Assume $string contains the value abcdabcd. What value is returned by each of the following calls?
a.    index ($string, "bc"); -> 1
b.    index ($string, "bcde"); -> -1
c.    index ($string, "bc", 1); -> 1
d.    index ($string, "cd", 3); -> 6
e.    rindex ($string, "bc"); -> 5

Assume $string contains the value abcdabcd\n (the last character being a trailing newline character). What is returned in $retval by the following?
a.    $_ = $string; $retval = tr/ab/ab/; -> 4
b.    $retval = length ($string); -> 9
